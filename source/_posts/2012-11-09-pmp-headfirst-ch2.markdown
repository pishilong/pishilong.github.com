Ch 2. Organizations, constrains, and projects 

     Organizations: Functional -> Weak Matrix -> Balanced Matrix -> Strong Matrix -> Projected

 

     Operational Work: Which has no beginning and has no end.

        

     Stackholders are impacted by your project.

     A stackholder is anyone who is affected either positively or negatively by the cost, time, scope, resources, quality, or risk of your project.

     It's possible to "turn around" a negative stackholder.

   

     Project constrains: Time , Cost, Scope, Resources, Quality, Risk

     All six of the constrains are related to each other. 

     There is almost never an easy, obvious trade-off where you can sacrifice one to improve the others.



     A portfolio charter will give the business goal that a group of projects and programs will accomplish as part of a portfolio.

     A program is a group of projects that should be managed together because of interdependencies.
